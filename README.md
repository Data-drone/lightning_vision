# Computer Vision Experiments with Torch Lightning

A repo to experiment on computer vision with pytorch lightning

## TODO

- try and get a backprop stage profiled
- test nvprofiler
- debug why torch profiler sometimes seems to fail 
- compare with scalene

## Current Focus

Experimenting with benchmarking models and profiling code leveraging scalene for now will also test nvidia profiler
